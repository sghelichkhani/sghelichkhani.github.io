  abstract        = {Mantle convection is a fundamental planetary process. Its plate mode is established and expressed by plate tectonics. Its plume mode also is established and expressed by interregional geological patterns. We developed both an event-based stratigraphic framework to illustrate the surface effects predicted by the plume model of Griffiths et al. (1989) and Griffiths and Campbell (1990) and a methodology to analyze continent-scale geological maps based on unconformities and hiatuses. The surface expression of ascending plumes lasts for tens-of-millions-of-years and rates vary over a few million years. As the plume ascends, its surface expression narrows, but increases in amplitude, leaving distinct geological and stratigraphic patterns in the geologic record, not only above the plume-head center, but also above its margins and in distal regions a few thousands-of-kilometers from the center. To visualize these patterns, we constructed sequential geological maps, chronostratigraphic sections, and hiatus diagrams. Dome-uplift with erosion (Şeng{\"{o}}r, 2001) and the flood basalts (Duncan and Richards, 1991; Ernst and Buchan, 2001a) are diagnostic starting points for plume-stratigraphic analyses. Mechanical collapse of the dome results in narrow rifting (Burke and Dewey, 1973), drainage-network reorganization (Cox, 1989), and flood-basalt eruption. In the marginal region, patterns of vertical movement, deformation and surface response are transient and complex. At first, the plume margin is uplifted together with the central region, but then it subsides as the plume ascents farther; With plume-head flattening, the plume margin experiences renewed outward-migrating surface uplift, erosion, broad crustal faulting, and drainage reorganization. Knickpoint migration occurs first inward-directed at ½ the rate of plume ascent and later outward-directed at the rate of asthenospheric flow. Interregional-scale unconformity-bounded stratigraphic successions document the two inversions. The distal regions, which did not experience any plume-related uplift, yield complete sedimentary records of the event; Event-related time gaps (hiatuses) in the sedimentary record increase towards the center, but the event horizon is best preserved in the distal region; it may be recognized by tracing its contacts from the center outwards. We extracted system- and series-hiatuses from interregional geological maps and built hiatus maps as proxies for paleo-dynamic topography and as a basis for comparison with results from numerical models. Interregional-scale geological maps are well suited to visualize plume-related geological records of dynamic topography in continental regions. However, geological records and hiatus information at the resolution of stages will be needed at interregional scales. The plume-stratigraphic framework is event-based, interregional, but not global, with time-dependent amplitudes that are significantly larger than those of global eustatic sea-level fluctuations. Global stratigraphic syntheses require integration of plate- and plume-stratigraphic frameworks before eustatic contributions may be assessed.},

All Rights Reserved.A striking feature of the Indian Ocean is a distinct geoid low south of India, pointing to a regionally anomalous mantle density structure. Equally prominent are rapid plate convergence rate variations between India and SE Asia, particularly in Late Cretaceous/Paleocene times. Both observations are linked to the central Neo-Tethys Ocean subduction history, for which competing scenarios have been proposed. Here we evaluate three alternative reconstructions by assimilating their associated time-dependent velocity fields in global high-resolution geodynamic Earth models, allowing us to predict the resulting seismic mantle heterogeneity and geoid signal. Our analysis reveals that a geoid low similar to the one observed develops naturally when a long-lived back-arc basin south of Eurasia's paleomargin is assumed. A quantitative comparison to seismic tomography further supports this model. In contrast, reconstructions assuming a single northward dipping subduction zone along Eurasia's margin or models incorporating a temporary southward dipping intraoceanic subduction zone cannot sufficiently reproduce geoid and seismic observations.},

  abstract        = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.The adjoint method is a powerful means to obtain gradient information in a mantle convection model relative to past flow structure. While the adjoint equations in geodynamics have been derived for the conservation equations of mantle flow in their incompressible form, the applicability of this approximation to Earth is limited, because density increases by almost a factor of two (Dziewonski and Anderson, Phys Earth Planet Inter 25:297–356, 1981) from the surface to the Core Mantle Boundary. Here we introduce the compressible adjoint equations for the conservation equations in the anelastic-liquid approximation. Our derivation applies an operator formulation in Hilbert spaces, to connect to recent work in seismology (Fichtner et al., Phys Earth Planet Inter 157(1–2):86–104, 2006b) and geodynamics (Horbach et al., Int J Geomath 5(2):163–194, 2014), where the approach was used to derive the adjoint equations for the wave equation and incompressible mantle flow. We present numerical tests of the newly derived equations based on twin experiments, focusing on three simulations. A first, termed Compressible, assumes the compressible forward and adjoint equations, and represents the consistent means of including compressibility effects. A second, termed Mixed, applies the compressible forward equation, but ignores compressibility effects in the adjoint equations, where the incompressible equations are used instead. A third simulation, termed Incompressible, neglects compressibility effects entirely in the forward and adjoint equations relative to the reference twin. The compressible and mixed formulations successfully restore earlier mantle flow structure, while the incompressible formulation yields noticeable artifacts. Our results suggest the use of a compressible formulation, when applying the adjoint method to seismically derived mantle heterogeneity structure.},

  abstract        = {Although mantle convection at Earth-like vigor is a chaotic process, it has been shown by conceptual studies that one can constrain its flow history back in time for periods comparable to a mantle overturn, ≈ 100 million years, if knowledge of the tangential surface velocity field and estimates on the present-day heterogeneity state are available. Such retrodictions, enabled through computationally demanding adjoint methods, are a promising tool to improve our understanding of deep Earth processes, and to link uncertain geodynamic modeling parameters to geologic observables. Here we present the first mantle flow retrodictions for geodynamically plausible, compressible, high resolution Earth models with ≈ 670 million finite elements, going back in time to the Mid Paleogene. Our retrodictions involve the dynamic effects from a low viscosity zone (LVZ) in the upper mantle, assimilate a past plate motion model for the tangential surface velocity field, and probe the influence from uncertain modeling parameters by using two different estimates for the present-day heterogeneity state of the mantle as imaged by two recent seismic tomographic studies, and two different values for deep mantle viscosity. Focusing on the African hemisphere, we find that our retrodictions produce a spatially and temporally highly variable asthenosphere flow with faster-than-plate velocities, and a history of dynamic topography characterized by local doming events, in agreement with considerations on plate driving forces, and regional scale uplifts reported in the geologic literature. Our results suggest that improved constraints on non-isostatic vertical motion of Earth's surface — provided, for instance, by basin analysis, seismic stratigraphy, landform studies, or the sedimentation record — will play an important role in our understanding of the recent mantle flow history.},

However, while gravity is sensitive to dynamically supported topography, there are only small free-air gravity anomalies ( {\textless} 30 mGal) associated with Earth's long-wavelength topography. This has been used to suggest that surface heights computed assuming a complete isostatic equilibrium provide a good approximation to observed topography. Here we show that the apparent paradox is resolved by the well-established formalism of global, self-gravitating, viscously stratified Earth models. The models predict a complex relation between dynamic topography, mass, and gravity anomalies that is not summarized by a constant admittance—i.e., ratio of gravity anomalies to surface deflections—as one would infer from analytic flow solutions formulated in a half-space. Our results suggest that sizable dynamic topography may exist without a corresponding gravity signal.},

The periodic signals and trends retrieved by these missions are induced by mass redistribution in the Earth system, carrying essential information on dynamic processes in the atmosphere, cryosphere, continental hydrosphere, the oceans and the solid Earth. While temporal gravity signals induced by deep Earth's processes are commonly thought to lie below the observational threshold of satellite gravity missions, as one assumes them to be small in amplitude and restricted to the longest spatial and temporal scales, there exists evidence from the geologic record for rapid uplift and subsidence events at regional scales, especially along passive continental margins, related to flow in the underlying mantle. Here we explore novel mantle flow retrodictions for geodynamically plausible, compressible, high resolution Earth models with ≈ 670 million finite elements. These time-dependent Earth models link to geologic observables in the late Paleogene that can be tested independently, while at the same time indicating mantle flow induced geoid rates on the order of 5 $\mu$m/year, at spatial scales of 1000 km. We assess the signal retrievability of the modeled rates in closed-loop numerical simulations, with different satellite gravity retrieval mission assumptions, including GRACE, GRACE-FO and a next generation gravity mission. We find the modeled deep Earth signal to be on the edge of detectability, but coming into the range of detectability in future temporal gravity field solutions, suggesting the use of satellite gravity data to validate geodynamic Earth models. Importantly, the application of forward modeled dynamic mantle signals seems to be essential for improved de-aliasing and signal separation in future gravity missions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Oceanic residual depth varies on 5,000 km wavelengths with amplitudes of ±1 km. A component of this short-wavelength signal is dynamic topography caused by convective flow in the upper ∼300 km of the mantle. It exerts a significant influence on landscape evolution and sea level change, but its contribution is often excluded in geodynamic models of whole-mantle flow. Using seismic tomography to resolve buoyancy anomalies in the oceanic upper mantle is complicated by the dominant influence of lithospheric cooling on velocity structure. Here, we remove this cooling signal from global surface wave tomographic models, revealing a correlation between positive residual depth and slow residual velocity anomalies at depths <300  km. To investigate whether these anomalies are of sufficient amplitude to account for short-wavelength residual depth variations, we calibrate an experimentally derived parameterization of anelastic deformation at seismic frequencies to convert shear wave velocity into temperature, density, and diffusion creep viscosity. Asthenospheric temperature anomalies reach +150°C in the vicinity of major magmatic hot spots and correlate with geochemical and geophysical proxies for potential temperature along mid-ocean ridges. Locally, we find evidence for a ∼150 km-thick, low-viscosity asthenospheric channel. Incorporating our revised density structure into models of whole-mantle flow yields reasonable agreement with residual depth observations and suggests that ±30 km deviations in local lithospheric thickness account for a quarter of total amplitudes. These predictions remain compatible with geoid constraints and substantially improve the fit between power spectra of observed and predicted dynamic topography. This improvement should enable more accurate reconstruction of the spatiotemporal evolution of Cenozoic dynamic topography.},

We present numerical predictions and observations of the variation in H over time scales ranging from tens of millions of years to decades. The geophysical processes controlling this variation include solid-state convection in the rocky mantle of the Earth that drives plate tectonics, isostatic adjustments due to ice age loading, and ice-ocean mass transfer linked to modern global climate change. The time dependence of H is complex and non-linear, and thus, in contrast to previous suggestions, cannot be captured by a constant rate parameter.},

  abstract  = {The slow creeping motion of Earth's mantle drives transient changes in surface topography across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Recent decades have seen substantial progress in understanding this so-called “dynamic topography,” with a growing number of studies highlighting its fundamental role in shaping the surface of our planet. In this review, we outline the current frontiers of geodynamical research into dynamic topography. It begins with a summary of ongoing observational, theoretical, and computational efforts that aim to quantify the present-day expression of dynamic topography, including its geographical distribution and sensitivity to different components of the mantle's flow regime. Next, observational constraints that shed light on how dynamic topography has changed over time are summarized, and compared with predictions from a range of geodynamical modeling studies, to highlight our current understanding of its evolution through the geological past. Although many model predictions can be reconciled with the available observational constraints, these comparisons demonstrate that there remain inconsistencies, particularly at shorter spatial and temporal scales. These discrepancies allow us to isolate the shortcomings of existing modeling approaches and identify pathways toward improving future reconstructions of dynamic topography through space and time. Such reconstructions are vital if we are to robustly connect the evolution of Earth's surface environments to the processes that are occurring deep within its interior.},

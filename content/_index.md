Hi! I'm **Sia Ghelichkhan** (Siavash Ghelichkhan), a numerical geophysicist at the Australian National University. Welcome to my corner of the internet!

This is where I share my research in numerical methods for geophysical continua—including mantle convection, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), and groundwater modelling. You'll find resources to follow along with what I'm working on, plus my thoughts on topics I'm genuinely excited about. Feel free to poke around and get to know me and my work better!

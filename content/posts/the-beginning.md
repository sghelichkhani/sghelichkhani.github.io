## Hello World!
**New!** This is an experimental page where I plan to post thoughts and updates about the work I do. Most of my research involves numerical modelling and high-performance computing to better understand processes in the Earth system. I’m also interested in how we can use these tools to connect different areas of science, and in sharing what I learn through teaching and open resources.

This space is also for experimenting with new ways of working and sharing ideas. I might post short notes, simple examples, or early tests of methods and tools. It’s not meant to be polished — more a place to keep track of ideas as they develop.

This section showcases the research projects I am currently working on, spanning mantle convection, GIA, and groundwater modelling. My work focuses on understanding complex Earth system processes through numerical modeling and high-performance computing. I am always interested in collaborating with motivated students and researchers who share a passion for tackling challenging problems in Earth sciences.

If you are a student interested in any of these research areas or would like to discuss potential collaboration opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me at [siavash.ghelichkhan@anu.edu.au](mailto:siavash.ghelichkhan@anu.edu.au).
